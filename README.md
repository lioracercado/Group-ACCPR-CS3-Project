Punching Game

Description:
The Punching Game is a single-player game where the player engages in a virtual face-off against an opponent. 
The player can choose to either attack or defend, while the opponent's actions are determined randomly. 
The game tracks the health status of both the player and the opponent, with the first to reach zero health losing the game. A coin toss at the beginning determines which player gets to attack first. 

How to Play:
1.) Click the dropdown button and choose if you want to be heads or tails.
2.) After picking, click the "Toss Coin" button to determine if you'll attack or defend.
  --You'll be able to play offense first if the flipped coin matches with your initial choice; defense if otherwise--
    For example: you picked tails
                 Tossed coin result: TAILS
                 you will attack 
3.) Shortly, a message will flash determining which side of the game you'll play; attack or defend.
4.) Click the "attack" button if you're in the offense, and click the "defend" button if otherwise.
5.) The game will update the health status of both players after each round.
6.) Keep playing until one of the players' health status reaches zero.
7.) Reset the game once the battle's over.
